More units are better to build up a strong, versatile force.\n- Only produce ranged, light, and worker units.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units.\n- Send both ranged and light units to attack buildings, while workers can focus on supporting and flanking. Workers can also be used to repair or construct defense if needed.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the Defense Feature is set to None, and focus on offensive operations.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units such as heavy units.\n- Do not plan for deploying units for defense, just focus on attacking.\n- Avoid getting caught in prolonged engagements with enemy units; prioritize destroying buildings to cripple the enemy's economy and production capabilities.",
