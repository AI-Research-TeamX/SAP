    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to support ongoing economic growth.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 6.\n- Focus on producing both Light and Worker units.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense over attacking in the early stage (0~200 time steps).\n- Deploy your defense at a medium distance (distance = 2) from the base, allowing a perimeter of protection around your position.\n- Use both Light and Worker units in your defensive strategy. Light units can engage enemies at a closer range, while Workers can support by providing additional numbers and potentially repairing or reinforcing the base.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except Light and Worker units.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy leans towards defense in the early stage.\n- Avoid placing your defense too close or too far from the base, as the ideal perimeter is medium (distance = 2).",
