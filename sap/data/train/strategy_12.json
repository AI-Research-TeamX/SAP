Producing more units will strengthen your forces.\n- Only produce Light, Heavy, and Worker units.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy units over buildings, focusing on eliminating the enemy's workforce and military.\n- Send both your workers and military units to attack, not just a single type, as your Military Feature is Light and Heavy and Worker.\n- Focus on aggressive play, and do not plan for specific defense areas, as your Defense Feature is None.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except the specified types (Light, Heavy, and Worker).\n- Do not wait to build barracks; once resources exceed the threshold, start construction immediately.\n- Do not prioritize defensive maneuvers, as the strategy is designed for aggressive play.\n- Avoid producing units unnecessarily; focus on maintaining a balanced force that can both sustain the economy and engage in combat effectively.",
