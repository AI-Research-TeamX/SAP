    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate one worker for mineral harvesting to sustain economic development.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 6. This will allow you to diversify your military units by adding Light units to your force alongside Workers.\n- Focus on producing a combination of Light and Worker units. Light units provide a balance between mobility and attack power, while Workers help with resource collection and can also participate in defense.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense rather than attacking in the early stage (0~200 time steps).\n- Deploy your defense at a far distance (distance = 3) from the base, allowing a broader perimeter of protection around your position.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than Light and Worker units.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy leans towards defense in the early stage.\n- Avoid placing your defense too close to the base, as the ideal perimeter is far (distance = 3) to maximize the area of control and provide early warnings against enemy advances.",
