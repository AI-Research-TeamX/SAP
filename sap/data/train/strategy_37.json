More units are better for your offensive strategy.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units to disrupt their economy and military capabilities.\n- Send both Heavy and Worker units to attack, using the Workers to support and absorb damage while the Heavy units deal significant damage to enemy structures.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the Defense Feature is set to None. Focus on maintaining a mobile and aggressive force.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except Heavy units and Workers.\n- Do not plan for a defensive perimeter or defensive strategy; your focus should be on continuous offensive actions.\n- Avoid conservative playstyles that prioritize defense over attack, as the strategy is designed to be aggressive and proactive.",
