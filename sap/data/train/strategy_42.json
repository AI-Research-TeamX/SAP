    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to support a balanced economic and military growth.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 6, ensuring a timely production of diverse units.\n- Focus on producing a combination of ranged, light, and worker units. This mix provides both ranged and melee capabilities, enhancing your defensive and potential offensive flexibility.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defensive positioning and stability. Avoid initiating attacks in the early stages (0~200 time steps) to strengthen your base and unit composition.\n- Deploy your defense at a medium distance (distance = 2) from the base. This will allow you to create a buffer zone that can intercept enemy units before they reach your core structures.\n- Use workers for both harvesting and defensive support, ensuring that your econonomic and military capabilities are maintained.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than the specified (ranged, light, and worker).\n- Avoid initiating attacks or prioritizing offensive operations, as the strategy is defensive.\n- Do not place your defense too close or too far from the base, as the ideal perimeter is medium (distance = 2).\n- Refrain from overextending your resources by producing too many units too quickly, as this can leave you vulnerable to resource shortages.",
