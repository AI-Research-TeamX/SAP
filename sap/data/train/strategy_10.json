    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to support ongoing economic growth. This will ensure a steady flow of resources to sustain the production of advanced units.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 5. This will allow you to start producing advanced units as soon as possible.\n- Focus on producing a combination of ranged and heavy units. The ranged units will provide long-range support, while the heavy units will deal significant damage in close combat.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy buildings. This strategy aims to disrupt the opponent's base and resource generation early on, putting pressure on their ability to recover.\n- Send both ranged and heavy units to attack, leveraging the strengths of each unit type to maximize your offensive capabilities.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as your strategy is focused on aggressive play.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except the specified ranged and heavy units.\n- Do not delay building barracks once your resource threshold is met, as it is crucial for producing advanced units.\n- Avoid defensive positioning, as your strategy is centered around aggressive play and early offensive actions.",
