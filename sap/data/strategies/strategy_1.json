    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to support the economy and fund the construction of more units and buildings.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 8, allowing for the production of Heavy units which are more durable and deal higher damage.\n- Focus on producing Heavy and Worker units. Heavy units will serve as the frontline attackers, while Workers will support by dealing damage and potentially serving as a resource to replace fallen Heavy units.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy units over buildings, especially targeting enemy Workers and other support units to weaken the opponent's economy and military capabilities.\n- Send both Heavy and Worker units to attack, leveraging the high damage and durability of Heavy units and the mobility and resource efficiency of Worker units.\n- Since the Defense Feature is set to None, focus entirely on aggressive maneuvers and avoid setting up a designated defense perimeter.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units such as Ranged or Light units, as they are not part of this strategy.\n- Do not waste resources on building unnecessary structures or units that do not contribute to the aggressive approach.\n- Avoid setting up defensive positions, as the strategy is to maintain a constant offensive pressure on the enemy.",
