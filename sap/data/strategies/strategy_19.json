    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate one worker for mineral harvesting to sustain economic development.\n- Construct a barracks once resources exceed 6.\n- Focus on producing a balanced military force consisting of ranged, light, and worker units.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense over attacking in the early stage.\n- Deploy your defense at a far distance (distance = 3) from the base to create a robust perimeter of protection around your position.\n- Use the ranged units for long-range defense and the light units for quick response and flanking maneuvers.\n- Keep a few worker units to assist in repairing the base and any damaged structures.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than the specified ranged, light, and worker units.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy leans towards defense.\n- Avoid placing your defense too close or too far from the base, as the ideal perimeter is far (distance = 3).\n- Do not neglect the importance of maintaining a steady stream of resources by keeping your worker units actively mining.",
