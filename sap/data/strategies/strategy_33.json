    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to support ongoing economic growth.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 10. This threshold is higher than typical strategies, ensuring a solid economic base before military expansion.\n- Focus on producing a diverse military force consisting of heavy, light, and worker units. This combination provides a balanced approach to both offense and defense.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense rather than attacking in the early and mid stages of the game.\n- Deploy your defense at a very far distance (distance = 4) from the base, creating a strong perimeter that can protect against potential attacks while maintaining a strategic position for counter-attacks if necessary.\n- Regularly assess the resource levels and adjust your production to ensure a steady supply of units.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than the specified worker, heavy, and light units.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy leans towards defense.\n- Avoid placing your defense too close to the base, as the ideal perimeter is far (distance = 4) to provide a buffer zone.\n- Ensure that your resource management is efficient to support the higher cost of heavy and light units.",
