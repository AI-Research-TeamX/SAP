### Early Game Plan
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Use the initial worker to start harvesting resources from the nearest mineral field.
   - Build a second worker as soon as possible to increase resource income.

2. **Barracks Construction:**
   - Once you have 5 resources, build a barracks to start producing Ranged units.

3. **Unit Production:**
   - Prioritize producing Ranged units as soon as the barracks is built.
   - Continue producing Ranged units to build a strong attacking force.

4. **Attack Strategy:**
   - Send your Ranged units to attack enemy buildings, particularly their base and any resource-gathering units.
   - Focus on disrupting the enemy's economy by destroying their resource-generating units and buildings.

5. **Resource Management:**
   - Ensure that your two workers continue to harvest resources efficiently to support the production of Ranged units.

By following this strategy, you will focus on a strong, early-game aggression with a mix of economic stability and targeted attacks on enemy infrastructure. This approach leverages the long-range capabilities of Ranged units to disrupt the enemy while maintaining a steady resource flow."
