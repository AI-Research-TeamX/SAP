    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate one worker for mineral harvesting to sustain economic development.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 5.\n- Focus on producing both ranged and worker units. More units generally mean a stronger force.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units, as this can disrupt their economy and production capabilities.\n- Send both workers and ranged units to attack. Utilize the ranged units' ability to attack from a distance to weaken the enemy's defenses before engaging with worker units.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the strategy is to be aggressive and proactive rather than defensive.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except the specified types (ranged and worker).\n- Do not focus on defending a specific area, as the goal is to continuously pressure the enemy through attacks.\n- Avoid engaging in prolonged defensive strategies, as the strategy is designed to be aggressive and offensive.",
