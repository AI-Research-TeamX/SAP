    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to maximize resource collection and support the creation of a diverse military.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 9 to enable the production of Heavy and Light units.\n- Focus on producing a mix of Heavy, Light, and Worker units. The combination of these units provides both offensive and defensive capabilities.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize a defensive stance. In the early stage (0~200 time steps), focus on building up your base and unit strength.\n- Deploy your defense at a moderate distance (distance = 3) from the base. This allows you to create a strong perimeter that can effectively repel enemy attacks while keeping your base protected.\n- Use Worker units to assist in resource collection and support the production of Heavy and Light units.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than the specified (Heavy, Light, and Worker) units.\n- Avoid initiating attacks or offensive operations, as the strategy is defensive.\n- Ensure that the defense perimeter is maintained at a moderate distance (distance = 3) from the base, avoiding placing it too close or too far.\n- Do not neglect resource collection; maintaining a steady flow of resources is crucial for sustaining your defensive strategy.",
