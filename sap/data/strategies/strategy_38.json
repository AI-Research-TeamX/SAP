More units are better for both defense and potential future attacks.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense over attacking in the early to mid-stage (0~400 time steps).\n- Deploy your defense at a medium to far distance (distance = 3) from the base, allowing a substantial perimeter of protection around your position.\n- Focus on maintaining a strong defensive line to protect your base and resources, ensuring a stable economy and unit production.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than the specified ranged and heavy units.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy leans towards defense in the early stage.\n- Avoid placing your defense too close to the base, as the ideal perimeter is medium to far (distance = 3).",
