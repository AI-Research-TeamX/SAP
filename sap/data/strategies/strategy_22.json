The more units, the better, to maximize your offensive capabilities.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units, as this can disrupt their economy and resource generation.\n- Send all your ranged units to attack, leveraging their ranged attack to engage from a safe distance.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as your strategy is focused on aggressive play.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except ranged units.\n- Do not plan for a defensive strategy, as the focus is on continuous and aggressive attacks.\n- Avoid holding back units for defense; use them all to apply pressure on the enemy.",
