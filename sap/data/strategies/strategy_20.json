Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense over offensive actions.\n- Deploy your defense at a very far distance (distance = 4) from the base to create an outer perimeter to protect your resources and structures.\n- Use the ranged units to defend this perimeter, taking advantage of their ability to attack from a distance.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than the specified ranged units.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy leans towards defense.\n- Avoid placing your defense too close to the base, as the ideal perimeter is very far (distance = 4).\n- Ensure that your economic activities are not disrupted by enemy attacks by maintaining a strong and distant defensive line.",
