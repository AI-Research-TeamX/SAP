    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to ensure a steady resource flow.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 10, allowing for the production of a diverse military force.\n- Focus on producing a balanced mix of ranged, heavy, and worker units. Producing more units generally enhances your defensive capabilities.\n- Given the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defensive strategies over aggressive attacks, especially in the early to mid-game stages (0~400 time steps).\n- Deploy your defense at a medium distance (distance = 3) from the base to create a robust perimeter that can effectively repel enemy advances without being too far to support the base quickly.\n\nYou should not:\n- Avoid producing any unit types other than the specified (ranged, heavy, and worker) units.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy is defensive-focused.\n- Avoid positioning your defense too close or too far from the base; the ideal perimeter is at a distance of 3.\n- Ensure that you maintain a sufficient number of workers to continue harvesting resources, as this is crucial for sustaining your economy and military production.",
