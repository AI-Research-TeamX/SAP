More units will provide a stronger offensive capability.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units to disrupt the enemy's economy and production capabilities.\n- Send both ranged and heavy units to attack, as your Military Feature includes both unit types.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as your Defense Feature is set to None. Focus on aggressive play to overwhelm the enemy.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except the specified types (ranged and heavy).\n- Do not plan defensive deployments, as the focus is on aggressive play.\n- Avoid being too passive; keep the pressure on the enemy by continuously attacking buildings.",
