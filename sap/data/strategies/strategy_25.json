    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to support the economy, ensuring a steady resource flow.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 6, which will allow you to start producing military units.\n- Focus on producing a combination of ranged and light units. These units provide a balanced approach to both ranged and melee combat.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy units, particularly targeting their workers and combat units to weaken their economic and military capabilities.\n- Send both ranged and light units to attack, leveraging the ranged units' ability to strike from a distance and the light units' speed and maneuverability.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the focus is on an aggressive playstyle that aims to constantly pressure the opponent.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except ranged and light units.\n- Do not build a defensive perimeter or focus on holding ground, as the strategy is designed for aggressive play.\n- Avoid targeting enemy buildings initially; focus on eliminating enemy units to disrupt their operations.",
