    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to support ongoing economic growth.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 5.\n- Focus on producing Ranged units, as they can attack from a distance and are effective against both buildings and units.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units to disrupt the enemy's economy and production capabilities.\n- Send your Ranged units to attack, focusing on enemy buildings, as the strategy is aggressive (Aggression Feature: True).\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the strategy is focused on aggressive play and does not prioritize defense in the early stage.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except Ranged units.\n- Do not plan extensive defensive measures, just focus on attacking.\n- Avoid constructing additional buildings that are not necessary for your core strategy, such as multiple barracks or unnecessary bases.\n\n### Early Game Plan\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Use the initial worker to start harvesting resources from the nearest mineral field.\n   - Build a second worker as soon as possible to increase resource income.\n\n2. **Barracks Construction:**\n   - Once you have 5 resources, build a barracks to start producing Ranged units.\n\n3. **Unit Production:**\n   - Prioritize producing Ranged units as soon as the barracks is built.\n   - Continue producing Ranged units to build a strong attacking force.\n\n4. **Attack Strategy:**\n   - Send your Ranged units to attack enemy buildings, particularly their base and any resource-gathering units.\n   - Focus on disrupting the enemy's economy by destroying their resource-generating units and buildings.\n\n5. **Resource Management:**\n   - Ensure that your two workers continue to harvest resources efficiently to support the production of Ranged units.\n\nBy following this strategy, you will focus on a strong, early-game aggression with a mix of economic stability and targeted attacks on enemy infrastructure. This approach leverages the long-range capabilities of Ranged units to disrupt the enemy while maintaining a steady resource flow.",
