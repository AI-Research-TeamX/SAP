    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to support ongoing economic growth.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 7.\n- Keep producing a mixed force of military units (ranged, light, and worker). Prioritize this composition for a balanced attack and utility.\n- Focus on producing these units as soon as possible, as more units will increase your chances of winning.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy units over buildings. The combination of ranged and light units will help in taking down both enemy units and structures effectively.\n- Send your units to actively engage the enemy, using the ranged units to attack from a distance and the light units to tackle closer threats.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the Defense Feature is set to None. Focus on constant pressure and offensive maneuvers.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except the specified types (ranged, light, and worker).\n- Do not establish a specific defense perimeter, as the strategy is geared towards aggression.\n- Avoid over-focusing on building defenses, as the strategy is to maintain a constant offensive stance.",
