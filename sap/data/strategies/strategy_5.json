More units are better.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy units over buildings.\n- Send both workers and light units to attack, leveraging the mobility and damage output of light units while using workers for additional support.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the Defense Feature is set to None.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except the specified Light and Worker units.\n- Do not prioritize defending a specific perimeter area or deploying defensive units, as the strategy is focused on aggression.\n- Avoid building too many workers beyond the initial two, as the focus is on military units to maintain pressure on the opponent.",
