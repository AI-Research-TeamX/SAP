More units are better.\n- Prioritize the production of light and heavy units, as they provide a balanced attack and defense capability.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units, as the Attack Feature is set to Building.\n- Send all units, including workers, to attack, rather than just using a single type, as your Military Feature includes Light, Heavy, and Worker.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the Defense Feature is set to None, focusing on aggressive play.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except the specified types (Light, Heavy, Worker).\n- Do not plan a defensive perimeter, as the strategy is focused on aggression.\n- Avoid building barracks prematurely; wait until resources exceed 10 to ensure a steady flow of military units.",
