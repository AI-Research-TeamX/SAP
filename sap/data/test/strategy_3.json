More units will enhance your offensive capabilities.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy units over buildings to weaken their economic and military capabilities.\n- Send a balanced mix of units to attack, with ranged units providing long-range support and light units dealing quick, high-damage strikes.\n- Focus on aggressive play, continuously pressuring the enemy and preventing them from establishing a strong economic or military presence.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except the specified types (ranged, light, and worker).\n- Do not prioritize defense or establish a defense perimeter, as the strategy is aggressive and focuses on continuous offensive actions.\n- Avoid holding back your units; always keep them engaged in attacks or on the move to pressure the enemy.",
