    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to support ongoing economic growth.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 5 to enable the production of advanced units.\n- Keep producing a mix of heavy, light, and worker units. More units will strengthen your defensive and offensive capabilities.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense and hold your ground rather than launching aggressive attacks in the early and mid-game stages.\n- Deploy your defense at a moderate distance (distance = 3) from the base. This will provide a well-rounded perimeter that is neither too close nor too far, allowing you to react to threats effectively.\n- Use heavy units for their high attack power and light units for their speed and versatility. Workers can support both economic and military roles by repairing structures and assisting in attacks if needed.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than the specified heavy, light, and worker units.\n- Do not initiate aggressive attacks, as the strategy leans towards defense.\n- Avoid overextending your units by keeping them within the designated defense perimeter to maintain a strong defensive position.",
